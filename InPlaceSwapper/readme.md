 Essentialy you use algebra. You have 3 varibales and 2 knowns at anyone time. That means you can always find out the last variable
 First, do first + second = sum and put it into the first position. 
 then to put the first number into the second position, first = sum - second 
 finally to get the second number back and in the first position, second = sum - first
 
 def swap(a, b):
    a = a + b
    b = a - b
    a = a - b
    return a, b
